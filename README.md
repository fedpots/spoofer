# Profile Spoofer (Custom Vencord Plugin)

A clean, lightweight **custom Vencord plugin** that lets you **spoof profile visuals locally** — including **username** and **badges** — with editable settings.

> **Client-side only:** This does **not** change anything on Discord’s servers. It only affects what **you** see in your own client.
